# 🔶Problem Statement.

- AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities ***Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra***. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next Few years.
<br>


- AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few ***" key customers did not extend the annual contract*** due to service issues".
	- It is speculated that some of the essential products were either "not delivered on time" or "not delivered in Full Quantity" over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service.

	- Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their ***supply chain analytics team*** to track the ‘On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.<br>
  
<br>

- The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘on-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full quantity delivery (IF) %’ and OnTime in full quantity (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

<br>

A few key customers haven't renewed the annual contract due to the service issues. This might have resulted in the bad service experience. Hence, the managenent wants to track the "On-Time" & In-Full" delivery service levels for all the customers on daily basis to fix them and later expand the business to new cities.

<br>


<hr>

In my project, I used Dex queries to get and organize data. With ***Power BI***, I created new columns and turned the data into insightful visuals. 
- The main focus was on making a "user-friendly dashboard" that shows important supply chain details for AtliQ Mart. 
- This dashboard helps in making smart decisions to improve the FMCG supply chain efficiently.
