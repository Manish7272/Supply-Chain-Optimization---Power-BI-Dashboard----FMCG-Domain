# ðŸ”¶Problem Statement.

- AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next 2 years.

- AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key ***customers did not extend the annual contract*** due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service.
  <br> Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their ***supply chain analytics team*** to track the â€™On timeâ€™ and â€˜In Fullâ€™ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

- The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure â€˜on-time delivery (OT) %â€™, â€˜In-full delivery (IF) %â€™ and OnTime in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

In my project, I used Dex queries to get and organize data. With Power BI, I created new columns and turned the data into insightful visuals. The main focus was on making a user-friendly dashboard that shows important supply chain details for AtliQ Mart. This dashboard helps in making smart decisions to improve the FMCG supply chain efficiently.
